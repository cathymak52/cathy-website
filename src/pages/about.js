      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>
        I am based in Manchester and have passion for learning new technology
        skills in my spare time. I believe in providing excellent product that
        exceeds client's expectations. I also enjoy working with data analysis,
        excellent problem solving and a strong eye for detail skills. I am
        looking forward to working on interesting projects (front/back end
        development) for either startups or established companies. The website I
        develop is quick and easy to use. Prior to embarking on working in the
        IT sector, I gained a vast amount of experience working within the
        public sector for over ten years. I've had the opportunity to develop my
        communication and human relationship skills used with clients and
        colleagues. Also in my spare time, I enjoy exercising, reading and
        having healthy meals.
