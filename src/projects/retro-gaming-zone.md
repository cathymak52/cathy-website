### Overview of the Tour project
It shows a list of tours where one is able to view an image of the tour, the price and brief overview of the place. One is able to click on Read More or Show less button; there is also the ability to remove a specific tour from the list of tours. When there are no tours left to view, one is able to refresh the screen to view the tours again.
